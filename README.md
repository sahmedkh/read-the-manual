# Read the Manual (RAG System)

<p><b>Read the Manual</b> is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer user queries based on manuals that users upload. This system leverages large language models (LLMs) along with a retrieval mechanism to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers from the manual content.</p>

## Experimental Version

<p>The <b>Experimental</b> folder contains the current version of the project where ongoing experiments are conducted. You can explore this version if you're interested in looking at the code. Once a satisfactory level is achieved, I plan to build a web app around it.</p>

## Demo

<p>The <b>Experimental</b> version of this project utilizes an instruction manual for a coffee machine as a sample dataset. Below is an example of the input and output generated by the system.</p>

>>> How can I froth milk for my cappuccino?
```

```
To froth milk for your cappuccino, follow these steps:

1. Fill a container (preferably one with a handle to avoid scalding) with about 100 grams of milk for each cappuccino. Remember that the milk will double or triple in volume.
2. Make sure the cappuccino maker selection ring is positioned downwards in the "CAPPUCCINO" position.
3. Turn the cappuccino maker slightly outwards to allow containers of any size to be used.
4. Immerse the cappuccino maker in the milk container.
5. Press the button.
6. When the light in the button flashes, turn the steam dial to the I position. Steam will be delivered from the cappuccino maker, making the milk frothy.
7. For a creamier froth, swirl the container slowly, moving it from the bottom upwards.
8. When you have obtained the required froth, stop steam delivery by turning the steam dial to the O position.
